# Events (CIF JavaScript API reference)

All client-side code is initiated by events and the events occur in Dynamics 365 Unified Interface. You associate s specific function in a JavaScript library to execute when an event occurs. This specific function is called an *event handler*.

Each event handler specifies a function within a JavaScript library and the parameters that you can pass to the function. The JavaScript API provides methods that you can use to attach event handlers to the events.

## Events

| [onclicktoact]() | Invoked when user selects the outbound communication (ClickToAct) field in a form. |
