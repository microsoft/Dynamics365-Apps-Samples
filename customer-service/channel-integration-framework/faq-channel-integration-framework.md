## Can partners package solutions that have a dependency on the Channel Integration Framework (CIF) solution, together with the CIF solution?
No, the Channel Integration Framework (CIF) solution should not be bundled with another solution. Partners can create solutions that add a check to their package looking for the Channel Integration Framework (CIF) solution (also mentioning the minimum supported version), which causes installation to fail in case the CIF solution is not present.

Also, you can add Configuration Experience to the acquire flow that will allow the solution to detect the state of the target instance, and decide how to install. This will also let the solution do any additional setup or license acquisition remotely before installing.
