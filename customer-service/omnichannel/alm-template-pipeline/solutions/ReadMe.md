# Solutions
This directory is used to group components for solutions together. In this example we have the following solutions: FirstParty and boilerplate. This repository produces two different solutions, and to keep their components organized we group them into top level folders with the solutions name.

This is a recommended pattern for directory structure, but you may choose to organize your repository differently.

Under each solution folder you will find various templates for solution components and tests such as plugins, webresrouces, unit tests, integration tests, etc.

You can ignore the "NauManTest" directory. It contains a test project that is used to validate an internal utility.
